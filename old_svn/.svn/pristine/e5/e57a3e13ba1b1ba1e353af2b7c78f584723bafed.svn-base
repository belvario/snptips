1.1 Release Notes

(1.0.3 was re-designated 1.1)

- Added support for deCODEme raw data format.  Note - at this moment one still has to extract the .csv that contains the genotype data manually from the archive and set that file in the preference dialog box.
- Added support for using SNPTips without a data file at all - so users who have not yet been genotyped can use SNPTips to look up reference sites, etc. for SNPs on web pages.
- Fixed an issue where the balloon was being improperly repositioned when the browser window was resized.  Now the balloon is hidden when a resize occurs.
