	<p>Thanks for pointing that out. I think the SNP you are referring to is rs7498665. It turns out that rs10838738 is only genotyped on an older version of our platform, so some customers will see data for it but most will not. Luckily, there is another SNP genotyped in all customers that correlates perfectly with rs3101336 in European and Asian populations (and almost perfectly in African populations), so I've added that to the list above.</p>
