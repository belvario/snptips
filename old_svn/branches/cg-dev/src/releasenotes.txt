SNPTips by 5AM Solutions, Inc.

1.0.2 Release Notes

Known Issues - 

- Emailing/forwarding web pages that contain SNP rs#'s may include genotype information under certain circumstances.  A fix for this that provides much better isolation of genotype information from web content is under development for 1.0.3, due shortly.  This is our highest-priority fix.  For now, we suggest avoiding emailing content containing rs#'s when SNPTips is enabled until this is addressed.
- The close button on the popup balloon does not reposition correctly when the window is resized while the popup is showing

1.0.3 Release Notes

- The problem with sending the genotype when a page that contains rs# was fixed.
- We also added support for DecodeMe files but at this moment one still has to extract the .csv that contains the genotype data manually from the archive and set that file in the preference dialog box.
